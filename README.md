# Virtual-Reality-game-for-Cerebral-Palsy-patients
- Unity-based virtual reality game designed for the physical rehabilitation therapy of cerebral palsy patients. Utilized Google SDK for virtual environment creation. Incorporated BNO055 sensors to link real-world movements with the virtual environment. Applied ML, specifically a Linear Regression model, to correlate sensor derived coordinates with Virtual Reality coordinates.
- This GitHub repository includes a screen recording showcasing the final Unity game developed.
